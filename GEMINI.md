# Instructions for Gemini Agents

-   **Do not directly read from or write to the `.idea/` folder.** This folder contains IDE-specific configuration files that are not meant for direct modification by automated agents.
-   **Do not directly read from or write to the `.git/` folder.** To interact with the Git repository, always use `git` commands (e.g., `git status`, `git add`, `git commit`).
-   **The `README.md` file is the primary source of project information for human users.** The `GEMINI.md` file is for agent-specific instructions. Do not duplicate content between them.
